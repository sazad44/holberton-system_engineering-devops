## Status

Resolved, action items in progress

## Summary

IsItDown, our very popular and very useful site to indicate if other sites are
down, went down. A 500 Internal Server Error disabled access for our users for
about an hour while the issue was resolved. The irony was broadcast on Twitter
in similar form and tone to this one. An hour of server debugging led to a
resolution.

## Impact

Estimated 565M queries lost, $1B of ad revenue foregone or requested back by
companies whose ads were unable to be seen.

## Root Causes

Cascading failure due to combination of exceptionally high load and a resource leak when searches failed due to terms not being in the Shakespeare corpus. The newly discovered sonnet used a word that had never before appeared in one of Shakespeare's works, which happened to be the term users searched for. Under normal circumstances, the rate of task failures due to resource leaks is low enough to be unnoticed.

## Trigger

Latent bug triggered by sudden increase in traffic.

## Resolution

Directed traffic to sacrificial cluster and added 10x capacity to mitigate cascading failure. Updated index deployed, resolving interaction with latent bug. Maintaining extra capacity until surge in public interest in new sonnet passes. Resource leak identified and fix deployed.

## Detection

Borgmon detected high level of HTTP 500s and paged on-call.

## Lessons Learned

### What went well

* Monitoring quickly alerted us to high rate (reaching ~100%) of HTTP 500s
* Rapidly distributed updated Shakespeare corpus to all clusters

### What went wrong

* We're out of practice in responding to cascading failure
* We exceeded our availability error budget (by several orders of magnitude) due to the exceptional surge of traffic that essentially all resulted in failures

### Where we got lucky

* Mailing list of Shakespeare aficionados had a copy of new sonnet available
* Server logs had stack traces pointing to file descriptor exhaustion as cause for crash
* Query-of-death was resolved by pushing new index containing popular search term

## Timeline

2015-10-21 (*all times UTC*)

| Time  | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 14:51 | News reports that a new Shakespearean sonnet has been discovered in a Delorean's glove compartment |
| 14:53 | Traffic to Shakespeare search increases by 88x after post to */r/shakespeare* points to Shakespeare search engine as place to find new sonnet (except we don't have the sonnet yet) |
| 14:54 | **OUTAGE BEGINS** -- Search backends start melting down under load |
| 14:55 | docbrown receives pager storm, `ManyHttp500s` from all clusters |
| 14:57 | All traffic to Shakespeare search is failing: see <http://monitor/shakespeare?end_time=20151021T145700> |
| 14:58 | docbrown starts investigating, finds backend crash rate very high |
| 15:01 | **INCIDENT BEGINS** docbrown declares incident #465 due to cascading failure, coordination on #shakespeare, names jennifer incident commander |
| 15:02 | someone coincidentally sends email to shakespeare-discuss@ re sonnet discovery, which happens to be at top of martym's inbox |
| 15:03 | jennifer notifies shakespeare-incidents@ list of the incident |
| 15:04 | martym tracks down text of new sonnet and looks for documentation on corpus update |
| 15:06 | docbrown finds that crash symptoms identical across all tasks in all clusters, investigating cause based on application logs |
| 15:07 | martym finds documentation, starts prep work for corpus update |
| 15:10 | martym adds sonnet to Shakespeare's known works, starts indexing job |
| 15:12 | docbrown contacts clarac & agoogler (from Shakespeare dev team) to help with examining codebase for possible causes |
| 15:18 | clarac finds smoking gun in logs pointing to file descriptor exhaustion, confirms against code that leak exists if term not in corpus is searched for |
| 15:20 | martym's index MapReduce job completes |
| 15:21 | jennifer and docbrown decide to increase instance count enough to drop load on instances that they're able to do appreciable work before dying and being restarted |
| 15:23 | docbrown load balances all traffic to USA-2 cluster, permitting instance count increase in other clusters without servers failing immediately |
| 15:25 | martym starts replicating new index to all clusters |
| 15:28 | docbrown starts 2x instance count increase |
| 15:32 | jennifer changes load balancing to increase traffic to nonsacrificial clusters |
| 15:33 | tasks in nonsacrificial clusters start failing, same symptoms as before |
| 15:34 | found order-of-magnitude error in whiteboard calculations for instance count increase |
| 15:36 | jennifer reverts load balancing to resacrifice USA-2 cluster in preparation for additional global 5x instance count increase (to a total of 10x initial capacity) |
| 15:36 | **OUTAGE MITIGATED**, updated index replicated to all clusters |
| 15:39 | docbrown starts second wave of instance count increase to 10x initial capacity |
| 15:41 | jennifer reinstates load balancing across all clusters for 1% of traffic |
| 15:43 | nonsacrificial clusters' HTTP 500 rates at nominal rates, task failures intermittent at low levels |
| 15:45 | jennifer balances 10% of traffic across nonsacrificial clusters |
| 15:47 | nonsacrificial clusters' HTTP 500 rates remain within SLO, no task failures observed |
| 15:50 | 30% of traffic balanced across nonsacrificial clusters |
| 15:55 | 50% of traffic balanced across nonsacrificial clusters |
| 16:00 | **OUTAGE ENDS**, all traffic balanced across all clusters |
| 16:30 | **INCIDENT ENDS**, reached exit criterion of 30 minutes' nominal performance |
