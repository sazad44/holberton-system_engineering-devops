## Summary

IsItDown, our very popular and very useful site to indicate if other sites are
down, went down. A 500 Internal Server Error disabled access for our users for
about an hour while the issue was resolved. The irony was broadcast on Twitter
in similar form and tone to the following one. An hour of server debugging led
to a resolution.

### Impact

100% of users experienced outages in the form of a 500 Internal Server Error.
The whole user-facing site was unable to be reached. Estimated 565M queries
lost, $1B of ad revenue foregone or requested back by companies whose ads were
unable to be seen.

### Root Cause

500 Internal Server Error coming from PHP section of LAMP
(Linux Apache MySQL PHP) stack. Settings file contained a typo
which caused a *File Not Found* error on the PHP backend. It
was nearly invisible from the apache server because Apache
is not equipped with alerting capabilities to signal issues
with the content it was serving.

## Trigger

Any call to the server would trigger it due to the fact the PHP
halted by the error whenever it attempted to run.

## Resolution

The error was resolved through a simple typo fix. However, the
debugging process took the better part of an hour. A 500 error
means anything can be wrong with the server including the files and databases
it pulls from. Therefore, the first step was to the check the apache logs.
Apache only showed being started and stopped which is normal also indicating
that apache is writing to the logs in fact. Next, MySQL was checked. Databases
can go down and cause issues. Unfortunately, no issue could be found in the
MySQL logs either. Therefore, the problem was expected to be in the PHP code.
To debug PHP the debug mode for the PHP config was turned on. This changed the
server's response from 500 to 200. Great news, the problem is fixed, right?
Wrong. The server returned 200, but not because it was serving content. It
was rather serving something else. The good news is it served us the error in
the PHP files. It was a typo. On line 137 of the `wp-settings.php` file, a
require directive was referencing `class-wp-locale.phpp`. This file did not
exist. Why? It's extension was wrong. All PHP files have a `.php` extension.
`.phpp` is a silly oversight in typing the correct file name. Once the typo
was resolved the whole server was serving the correct website content.

## Detection

Borgmon experienced a 500 Internal Server error when trying to access our site
for his own personal inquiry into the status of another site..

## Corrective and Preventative Action Items

| Action Item | Type | Owner | Bug |
| ----------- | ---- | ----- | --- |
| Setup automatic testing through Travis CI in github | mitigate | jennifer | n/a **DONE** |
| Develop code review framework which includes local test | prevent | martym | Bug 5554823 **TODO** |
| Develop dummy site for 500 Internal Server redirect, potentially using other website status apis for info rather than ours | alternative action | docbrown | n/a **TODO** |
| Use development site for real testing prior to production deployment| prevent | jennifer | Bug 5554824 **TODO** |
| Facilitate communication between SRE and backend departments for more robust development | prevent | agoogler | Bug 5554825 **DONE** |
| Deploy updated wordpress site to prod | prevent | jennifer | n/a **DONE** |
| Develop monitoring and detection tools for quicker detection of issue | mitigate | SRE Team | n/a **TODO** |
| Freeze production until 2015-11-20 due to error budget exhaustion, or seek exception due to grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre, and unprecedented circumstances | other | docbrown | n/a **TODO** |

## Lessons Learned

* Never push untested code into production no matter how small the change

### What went well

* Debugging techniques were solid and used well in conjunction with development skills
* Production fix was quick

### What went wrong

* The debugging took too long
* Detection should have been much quicker

### Where we got lucky

* Twitter was a quick means of getting feedback from our users and someone was scrolling twitter instead of working
